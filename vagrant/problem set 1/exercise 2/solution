Using SQLAlchemy perform the following queries on your database:
1. Query all of the puppies and return the results in ascending alphabetical order
2. Query all of the puppies that are less than 6 months old organized by the youngest first
3. Query all puppies by ascending weight
4. Query all puppies grouped by the shelter in which they are staying

0. Setup

	from sqlalchemy import create_engine, asc
	from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
	from puppies import Base, Shelter, Puppy
	engine = create_engine('sqlite:///puppyshelter.db')
	Base.metadata.bind = engine
	DBSession = sessionmaker(bind = engine)
	session = DBSession()


1. Query all of the puppies and return the results in ascending alphabetical order

	puppies = session.query(Puppy).order_by(asc(Puppy.name)).all()
	for puppy in puppies:
	    print puppy.name


2. Query all of the puppies that are less than 6 months old organized by the youngest first

	puppies = session.query(Puppy).filter(Puppy.dateOfBirth >= '2016-06-30').order_by(asc(Puppy.dateOfBirth)).all()
	for puppy in puppies:
	    print puppy.name, puppy.dateOfBirth


3. Query all puppies by ascending weight

	puppies = session.query(Puppy).order_by(asc(Puppy.weight)).all()
	for puppy in puppies:
	    print puppy.name, puppy.weight


4. Query all puppies grouped by the shelter in which they are staying

	puppies = session.query(Puppy).order_by(asc(Puppy.shelter_id)).all()
	prevShelterId = ""
	for puppy in puppies:
	    if prevShelterId != puppy.shelter_id:
	    	if prevShelterId != "":
	    		print
	    	print puppy.shelter.name
	    	prevShelterId = puppy.shelter_id
	    	
	    print puppy.name
